# Yanguages

This website's purpose is to help someone with their language-learning journey! Current languages available are only in Spanish and Korean, and the plan is to continue incorporating more and more languages as this website is further polished. The user has three main courses of action upon entering the website: writing a diary that will be saved and managed in a remote MySQL database; playing a fun, interactive vocabulary game that tests their ability to remember English definitions of certain words for as long as possible (high scores are kept track of as well); maintaining a personal dictionary to which any word or phrase can be added for personal use. Authentication is also implemented as a username + password system. Users are managed by MySQL as well as their respective diary entries, personal dictionary items, and high scores.

# Tech Stack

WordsAPI, Google Translate API, MySQL, Next.js + Tailwind, Node.js, Axios, Passport.js
